NAME
  gmux-app-exit - system exit utility with confirmation dialog

SYNOPSIS
  The exit application provides a safe way to shut down the gmux desktop environment
  with a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental system shutdown.

DESCRIPTION
  The exit application is a system utility that initiates the shutdown of the gmux
  desktop environment. It displays a confirmation dialog to ensure the user intends
  to exit the system, preventing accidental shutdowns. The application provides a
  clean way to terminate the graphical environment and return to the console.

FEATURES
  - Confirmation dialog before shutdown
  - Clean system termination
  - Visual feedback for user actions
  - Safe exit process
  - Cancel option for accidental activation

WINDOW CONFIGURATION
  The exit application creates a confirmation dialog with the following specifications:
  - Width: 30 characters
  - Height: 2 characters
  - Position: (10,4) on screen
  - Title: "Exit"
  - Non-resizable dialog

DIALOG INTERFACE
  The exit application displays a simple confirmation dialog:
  - Question: "Are you sure you want to exit?"
  - Yes button: Confirms system shutdown
  - No button: Cancels the exit operation
  - Touch-based interaction

USAGE
  Launch the exit application from the gmux desktop:
  1. Click on the exit icon in the application menu
  2. A confirmation dialog will appear
  3. Click "Yes" to exit the system
  4. Click "No" to cancel and return to desktop

  Exit Process:
    - Confirmation dialog appears
    - User must explicitly confirm exit
    - System shutdown initiated upon confirmation
    - Clean termination of all processes
    - Return to console environment

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
  The exit application uses the gmux API for system shutdown:

  Application Structure:
    return {
        name = "Exit",
        icon = [[
/-------\
|  \ /  |
|  / \  |
\-------/]],
        run = function()
            -- Exit dialog implementation
        end
    }

  Dialog Creation Process:
    1. Create window buffer with confirmation dialog
    2. Display "Are you sure you want to exit?" message
    3. Show "Yes" and "No" buttons
    4. Handle touch events for button interaction
    5. Execute system exit or close dialog based on selection

  System Exit Process:
    - Call require("gmux/backend/core").exit()
    - Terminate all running processes
    - Clean up system resources
    - Return to console environment
    - Free GPU buffers and reset display

  Event Handling:
    - Touch events for button interaction
    - Position-based button detection
    - Immediate response to user input
    - Clean dialog closure on cancel

COLOR SCHEME
  The exit dialog uses standard colors:
  - Background: 0x000000 (black)
  - Foreground: 0xffffff (white)
  - Button background: 0xffffff (white)
  - Button text: 0x000000 (black)

DIALOG LAYOUT
  The confirmation dialog is laid out as follows:
  - Line 1: "Are you sure you want to exit?"
  - Line 2: "Yes     " (left side) "No       " (right side)
  - Touch areas: Left side for Yes, right side for No

SAFETY FEATURES
  The exit application includes several safety mechanisms:
  - Explicit confirmation required
  - Clear visual feedback
  - Cancel option always available
  - No accidental activation
  - Clean shutdown process

ERROR HANDLING
  - Dialog creation failures are handled
  - System exit errors are reported
  - Touch event processing errors are caught
  - Graceful fallback for display issues

LIMITATIONS
  - Fixed dialog size and position
  - No customization of exit message
  - No alternative exit methods
  - No shutdown options or preferences

SYSTEM INTEGRATION
  The exit application integrates with the gmux system:
  - Uses gmux backend core for system shutdown
  - Properly terminates all processes
  - Cleans up system resources
  - Resets display to console mode
  - Handles GPU buffer cleanup
