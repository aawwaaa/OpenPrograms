NAME
  gmux-app-monitor - system resource monitor and process manager

SYNOPSIS
  The monitor application provides real-time system monitoring and process management
  capabilities within the gmux graphical environment.

DESCRIPTION
  The monitor application is a comprehensive system monitoring tool that displays
  real-time information about system resources, running processes, and hardware
  components. It provides both monitoring capabilities and process management
  functions including process termination and information display.

FEATURES
  - Real-time process monitoring
  - System resource usage display
  - Component status information
  - Process management (kill, info)
  - Tabbed interface for different views
  - Interactive process selection

WINDOW CONFIGURATION
  The monitor application creates a window with the following specifications:
  - Width: 60 characters
  - Height: 14 characters
  - Process name: "Monitor"

INTERFACE LAYOUT
  The monitor uses a tabbed interface with three main sections:

  Process Tab:
    - List of all running processes
    - Process ID, status, and name
    - Interactive process selection
    - Process management actions (Info, Kill)

  Resource Tab:
    - CPU usage statistics
    - Memory usage with visual bars
    - Energy consumption display
    - GPU memory usage
    - Real-time updating graphs

  Component Tab:
    - List of all hardware components
    - Component types and addresses
    - Primary component indicators
    - Component status information

USAGE
  Launch the monitor application from the gmux desktop:
  1. Click on the monitor icon in the application menu
  2. The monitoring window will open with the Process tab active
  3. Use the tab bar to switch between different views
  4. Click on processes to select them for management

  Process Management:
    - Click on a process to select it
    - Use the Info button to view detailed process information
    - Use the Kill button to terminate selected processes
    - Process information is displayed in popup windows

  Resource Monitoring:
    - View real-time CPU usage
    - Monitor memory consumption
    - Track energy usage
    - Observe GPU memory utilization

  Component Information:
    - Browse all system components
    - Identify primary components
    - View component addresses and types

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
  The monitor application is implemented with real-time updating:

  Application Structure:
    return {
        name = "Monitor",
        draw_icon = function(gpu, colors, x, y)
            -- Icon drawing implementation
        end,
        graphics_process = {
            width = 60, height = 14,
            main = main, name = "Monitor"
        }
    }

  Real-time Updates:
    - Continuous monitoring with 1-second intervals
    - Automatic screen refresh
    - Dynamic data collection
    - Live process list updates

  Process Management:
    - Direct process interaction through gmuxapi
    - Process termination capabilities
    - Process information retrieval
    - Error handling for failed operations

  Resource Calculation:
    - CPU usage percentage calculation
    - Memory usage bar visualization
    - Energy consumption tracking
    - GPU memory monitoring

COLOR SCHEME
  The monitor uses different color schemes for different display depths:

  Colorful Mode (16-bit depth):
    - background: 0x000000
    - background_selected: 0x222222
    - background_input: 0x555555
    - primary: 0x00ffff
    - primary_selected: 0x00ffff
    - secondary: 0xff8800
    - secondary_selected: 0xff8800
    - text: 0xffffff
    - text_input: 0xffffff

  Black/White Mode (1-bit depth):
    - background: 0x000000
    - background_selected: 0xffffff
    - background_input: 0x000000
    - primary: 0xffffff
    - primary_selected: 0x000000
    - secondary: 0xffffff
    - secondary_selected: 0x000000
    - text: 0xffffff
    - text_input: 0x000000

PROCESS INFORMATION
  The monitor displays detailed process information including:
  - Process ID
  - Process status (running, stopped, etc.)
  - Process name
  - Parent process ID (if applicable)
  - Memory usage
  - CPU time

RESOURCE METRICS
  The monitor tracks various system resources:
  - CPU usage percentage
  - Memory usage with visual bars
  - Energy consumption
  - GPU memory utilization
  - Component count and status

ERROR HANDLING
  - Process termination errors are displayed
  - Invalid process operations are reported
  - Resource calculation errors are handled
  - Component access failures are logged

LIMITATIONS
  - Fixed window size (60x14 characters)
  - No historical data storage
  - Limited to current system state
  - No export or logging capabilities
