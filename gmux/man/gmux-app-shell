NAME
  gmux-app-shell - graphical shell terminal application

SYNOPSIS
  The shell application provides a command line terminal interface within the gmux
  graphical environment, allowing users to execute system commands and programs.

DESCRIPTION
  The shell application is a graphical wrapper around the OpenOS shell system,
  providing full terminal functionality in a windowed environment. It runs the
  standard OpenOS shell (/bin/sh.lua) with complete command line capabilities
  including command history, tab completion, and all standard shell features.

FEATURES
  - Full OpenOS shell compatibility
  - Command history and navigation
  - Tab completion for commands and files
  - Environment variable support
  - Process management and control
  - File system navigation
  - Program execution and piping

WINDOW CONFIGURATION
  The shell application creates a window with the following specifications:
  - Width: 75 characters
  - Height: 22 characters
  - Process name: "Shell"
  - Main program: /bin/sh.lua

ICON DESIGN
  The shell icon displays a terminal-style interface:
  - Terminal frame with borders
  - "OpenOS" branding
  - Command prompt (#) indicator
  - "Shell" label

USAGE
  Launch the shell application from the gmux desktop:
  1. Click on the shell icon in the application menu
  2. The terminal window will open with a command prompt
  3. Enter commands as you would in a standard terminal
  4. Use standard shell commands and syntax

  Common Commands:
    ls                    List directory contents
    cd <directory>       Change directory
    pwd                  Print working directory
    cat <file>           Display file contents
    echo <text>          Print text to terminal
    clear                Clear the terminal screen

  Shell Features:
    - Command history (up/down arrows)
    - Tab completion for files and commands
    - Environment variable expansion
    - Command chaining with && and ||
    - Input/output redirection with > and <

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
  The shell application is implemented as a standard gmux application:

  Application Structure:
    return {
        name = "Shell",
        draw_icon = function(gpu, colors, x, y)
            -- Icon drawing implementation
        end,
        graphics_process = {
            width = 75, height = 22,
            main_path = "/bin/sh.lua",
            name = "Shell"
        }
    }

  Process Management:
    - Runs in isolated process with virtual components
    - Dedicated virtual GPU for terminal display
    - Independent keyboard input handling
    - Isolated file system access

  Terminal Integration:
    - Direct integration with OpenOS shell system
    - Full terminal emulation capabilities
    - Support for all terminal control sequences
    - Proper signal handling for process control

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
  The shell inherits the standard OpenOS environment:
  - PATH: Command search path
  - HOME: User home directory
  - PWD: Current working directory
  - USER: Current user name
  - SHELL: Shell executable path

ERROR HANDLING
  - Command errors are displayed in the terminal
  - Invalid commands show appropriate error messages
  - Process termination is handled gracefully
  - Window closure properly terminates the shell

LIMITATIONS
  - Terminal size is fixed at 75x22 characters
  - No window resizing capability
  - Limited to single shell session per window
  - No support for multiple terminal tabs
