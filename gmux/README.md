## System Requirements

- OpenComputers mod
- Computer with graphics display support
- GPU component
- Keyboard component
- Screen component

## Installation

1. Ensure your OpenComputers environment is properly configured
2. Copy project files to your computer
3. Run the main program:
   ```lua
   require("gmux")
   ```

## Usage

### Starting the System
```lua
-- Run the main file directly
require("gmux")
```

### Running Applications
```lua
-- Use the start command to run programs
start /path/to/your/program.lua
```

### System Monitoring
- Use the Monitor application to view system resource usage
- Monitor CPU usage, memory usage, and energy status
- Manage running processes

### Developing Applications
```lua
-- Create a new graphical application
return {
    name = "My App",
    draw_icon = function(gpu, colors, x, y)
        -- Draw application icon
    end,
    graphics_process = {
        width = 80, height = 25,
        main_path = "/path/to/main.lua",
        name = "My App"
    }
}
```

## Technical Architecture

### Backend System
- **Process Management**: Support for multi-process concurrent execution
- **Virtual Components**: Abstract hardware component interfaces
- **Event Handling**: Unified event-driven architecture
- **Resource Management**: System resource allocation and monitoring

### Frontend System
- **Graphics Rendering**: Real-time graphical interface updates
- **Window Management**: Multi-window support and layout
- **User Interaction**: Keyboard and mouse event handling
- **Desktop Environment**: Application launching and management

### Application Framework
- **Modular Design**: Easily extensible application architecture
- **API Interface**: Standardized system call interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling mechanisms

## Development Guide

### Creating New Applications
1. Create application files in the `frontend/apps/` directory
2. Implement application interface (name, draw_icon, graphics_process)
3. Register applications in `frontend/main.lua`

### System API
- `component.gmuxapi` - Main API interface
- `api.create_window()` - Create windows
- `api.create_graphics_process()` - Create graphics processes
- `api.get_processes()` - Get process list
