== Summary ==

LÖVE (the software) is licensed under the terms of the ZLIB license. This is a very liberal license which permits almost anything. 

The old, imported documentation is licensed under the FreeBSD Documentation license. This is similar to ZLIB, but meant for written documents as opposed to software.
